## 🛠 What I Did  
- Cleaned demographic fields (age, gender, province, race) and handled missing values using `IFNULL`.

- Normalised timestamps and applied timezone corrections.  
- Created audience segments based on:  
  - **Age group**  
  - **Gender**  
  - **Race**  
  - **Province**  
- Identified viewership patterns:  
  - Most-watched channels

  - Day-of-week patterns  
  - Content preference by demographic segment  
- Visualised engagement trends to support insight communication.
